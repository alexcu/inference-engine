I would like to acknolwedge \citet{aima2009} as it was referenced for all
implementations of each entailment method, chiefly in their provided
psuedo-code for the algorithms. In addition, the lecture on converting to
conjunctive-normal form by \citet{meyden2000} helped significantly, as well as
the attached reference by \citet{huth2004}.

Lastly, to implement the tokeniser used in the implementation of parsing the
sentences from file, the article provided by \citet{swiftstudies} on creating
a generic tokeniser in the Swift programming langauge was useful.
