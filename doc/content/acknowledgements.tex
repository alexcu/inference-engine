I would like to acknolwedge \citet{aima2009} as it was referenced for all
implementations of each entailment method, chiefly in their provided
psuedo-code for the algorithms. In addition, the lecture on converting to
conjunctive-normal form by \citet{meyden2000} helped significantly, as well as
the attached reference by \citet{huth2004}.

The logic inference engine developed by \citet{pybool} was used as an alternate
inference engine to validate my conversions of conjunctive and normal forms. It
was helpful to have this secondary source to assert that my inference engine was
working as expected.

Lastly, to implement the tokeniser used in the implementation of parsing the
sentences from file, the article provided by \citet{swiftstudies} on creating
a generic tokeniser in the Swift programming langauge was useful.
