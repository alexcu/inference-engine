\begin{abstract}
  This assignment implements a basic inference engine using propositional logic
  to make inferences. In addition to the required truth table, forward and
  backward chaining methods, extensions to the inference engine were made. These
  extensions include a full propositional logic parser, making the truth table
  method more complete, as well as an additional entailment method---the
  resolution method. Since the resolution method was made, the inference engine
  is able to translate input sentences into conjunctive normal form, and thus
  also negation normal form.
